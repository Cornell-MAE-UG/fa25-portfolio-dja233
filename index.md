## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile picture S25.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY and a U.S. Navy veteran. I enjoy collaborating with other people and have much experience with team work under high stress situations as well as longer term tasks. My background prior to Cornell University is primarily with operations of nuclear propulsion plant systems for the U.S. Navy. While at Cornell I have learned many new skills such as python, Matlab, CAD, and foundational knowledge of Mechanical Engineering principles.
